## Installation

* Copy the `themes/learn2` directory to the cms_pico themes directory
* Copy the `learn2` directory to the cms_pico templates directory
* Copy the contents of the `plugins` directory to the cms_pico plugins directory

Go to the Administration pages for cms_pico in Nextcloud and add the theme,  templates, and plugins to cms_pico.

Create a new site, using **learn2** as your theme, and the **learn2** template to get these documents.

Might work :-)

## Modifications

Am trying to make it a little more accessible. Eg - remove h5 tags that are being used for formatting rather than as structural elements.

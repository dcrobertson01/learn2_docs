**Learn2** is hosted on github. There are three sub-repositories that can be downloaded individually or as one project. Using the sub-projects makes it easier to update in place without having to copy files around.

The sub-projects are 

1. Learn2_docs
the documentation
2. picocms_learn2
the theme
3. learn2_plugins
the plugins used.
